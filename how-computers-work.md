A Computer is a Machine that does 4 things
1. input
2. store
3. process
4. output

Unlike most other machines that help us physically, computers help us think.

All computers run on bits, the smallest form of information, this is can be stored as a 1 or a 0. You most likely wont have to deal with the 1 and 0 directly.

More bits allow for more complex information. All data stored on a computer can be broken down into 1 and 0.

Circits are the simple way that computers control information. More complcated criuits use more inputs. There are 6 basic logic gates and more complicated circuits are made up of more of these logic gates. Smaller circuits are smaller because it decreases the distance the information has to travel.

Input Devices: mouse, Keyboard, GPS, Sensors, Controlers
Memery: stores the instructions and information.
Cpu: converts instructions to information.
Output Devices:Screen, Projector, Robotics

New input and output devices have been/are being made allowing for different types of interaction. Improvement to CPU and Memery size and speed have allowed for more computation. The ability to have multiple CPU's running togather has also helped computational speeds.

Everything you do with a computer is about those 4 thing that make a computer a computer.

Hardware: the components that make up the physical computer

Software: The programs/code that run on a computer

The 2 parts communicate through the CPU. The CPU knows what circuit to use for spific tasks. Software code is high level information that is translated in to binary for the cpu to understand. Most software runs on a opperating system to control the other programs. The opperating system is really a program that helps the CPU pick what programs to run for fractions of a seccond.
