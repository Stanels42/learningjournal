# What I Learned About the Cloud

There was a sence of relife once we had finished the demenstration this morning, while I had worked in a console before they had always been imtimidating. Somehow in less time I feel I've got a better grasp of using to a console. The commands make more sence and the reasons for using it as well as the functionallty and pratcallity are far more clear.

As for any revisions Ive made a few but not many. I do highly intend to try to keep this site updated for the week cause it willprobably be the most reliable study tool that I will have this week. I've already put more work into the [Repository page](https://stanels42.github.io/learningjournal/repository) in the hopes that I won't have to go back through (but probably will) to add or change information.
