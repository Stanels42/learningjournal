For me growth mindset is all about being able to challange myself while also focusing on the task at hand. I've struggled in the past with being able to stay on task when being challenged and often giving up before I would ask for help. I need to take advantage of the resources around me to help with the obsticles in my way.  


_Three Points to Remember_  

______

**1.** Progress takes time. I know that most of what will be covered I will be capable of doing but I just need to focus and stay motaved to finish the work infront of me.  
**2.** Get comfortable in the enviorment. I have realized/known for a while that I am one of (if not) the youngest people in this program. I do feel confident in my abilities but being able to mesh with my fellow students may be my biggest challenge. I haven't had a problem with it at any of my food service jobs but I still want to watch this point.  
**3.** **_ASK FOR HELP WHEN I NEED IT_** I have a habit of keeping to myself; If I can't solve something myself I'll bang my head into a wall till the answer shows up (Doesn't usually work).
