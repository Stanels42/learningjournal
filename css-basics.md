# CSS Basics

## Terms

Block Elements - look like they are stacked on top of one another  
Inline Elements - elements that are in line(I know right?), left to right, with each other
###### There are other formations but these are the most common

| Selectors | Code | Uses |
|:----------|:----:|:-----|
| Universal Selector | `` | Used to select **everything** on the webpage. Useful for selecting the font or other such thing. |
| Type Selector | `p` |  |
| ID Selector | `` |  |
| Class Selector | `` |  |
| Child Selector | `` |  |
| Discendant Selector | `` |  |

`!improtant` - Used to override any other modifiers that might be used on an element

Color names - There are 127 built in color names
Hex codes - prefaced with a `#` and fallowed bya string of charactors
RGB Values - A set of 3 values each going up to 255 that combine to create a color
Hue -
Stauration -
Brightness -
Contrast - 
opacity - The value of how transparent a certain color is. In programming it is a value between 0 and 1.

## Code
|  Code  |  Use  |
|:-------|:------|
| `s {d}` |  |
|`<link>`  |  |
|`<style>`  |  |
|`property: value;` | The code format for changing the  |
|`color`| Used for changing the color of an element. All color changing elements use the 3 different systems listed above |
|`background-color`| Used for changing the background color of any given element |
|`opacity`| The value of how much you can 'see' through a color |
|`rgba`| Simular to the Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color selector but with another value that allows for the control of opacity |
|`hsl`/`hsla`|  |

## Rules
`!important` overrides any other command. When faced with 2 or more commands of equal importance only the last one will be listened to. Will always use the most specific selector.

When picking colors make sure there is enough contrast between the background and the text to be both readable while not putting too much strain on the eyes.
